## The Board

The schematic is loosely based on [our panda jungle v2](https://www.comma.ai/shop/panda-jungle), a development and debugging board for comma devices and pandas. This version includes:

* 12V DC input with onboard 5V and 3.3V supplies
* Four [OBD-C](https://github.com/commaai/hardware/blob/master/harness/OBD-C.sch.pdf) device ports with individually controlled power and current monitoring
* Four CAN transceivers and ignition simulation circuitry
* A USB hub and USB-C host connection
* An STM32H725 microcontroller and microSD card slot
* A push button and status LEDs

## The Challenge

Your goal is to make the most compact, efficient board that retains the same interfaces and functionality as the original design. The lowest score wins.

### Rules

* The bare PCB must be fully manufacturable by JLCPCB.
* It must be possible to actually assemble the PCBA.
* The assembled product must work and be usable.

### Prize

Lowest score on the [leaderboard](https://comma.ai/leaderboard#pcbgolf_challenge) by **October 12, 2026** wins **$1,000 cash**.

## Submission

Submit a `.zip` file containing your finalized KiCad project and a STEP file of the final assembly [here](https://forms.gle/US88Hg7UR6bBuW3BA).
Competitive scores will be posted on the [leaderboard](https://comma.ai/leaderboard#pcbgolf_challenge) after review. Multiple submissions allowed.

## Automated workflow

The repository includes a reproducible headless environment with KiCad 10.0,
Java 25, and Freerouting 2.4.1. Generated files stay under
`.pcbgolf-build/`.

```bash
make env-check
make prepare
make place
make route
make test
make score
```

`make pipeline` runs the placement → route → DRC/connectivity → score sequence.
The placement step floorplans interfaces and major ICs, then packs remaining
parts near their strongest electrical peers. Preparation and placement use
JLCPCB's 0.10 mm two-layer trace/space capability, 0.30 mm drills, and a
0.40 mm board. The score step exports the complete assembly, measures its 3D
bounding box, counts vias and copper layers, writes a JSON breakdown, and
produces the STEP assembly required for submission.
